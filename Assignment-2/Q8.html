    <h3>Program 8</h3>
    <div>A large company pays its salespeople on a commission basis. The salespeople receive $200 per week,
plus 9 percent of their gross sales for the week. For example, a salesperson who sells $5000 worth of
merchandise in a week receives $200 plus 9 percent of $5,000, or a total of $650. You have been
supplied with a list of the items sold by each salesperson. The value of these items are as follows:<br />
            <img src="Q8.png" /><br />
            Develop a script that inputs one salesperson’s items sold for last week, calculates the salesperson’s
earnings, and outputs HTML5 text that displays the salesperson’s earnings.</div>
